                <p > We all agree that we live in an age of the information revolution, which differs in its 
				characteristics from previous eras and the era of the information revolution is in support of 
				human ability and mental aspects of knowledge available to him as the quantitative production
				of information is characteristic of this age because of their Otheraly aspects of our various 
				public and on the economic aspects in particular.
                </p>
                
				<p >Since the emergence of the Faculty of Computer and Information in 1996 as one of the colleges 
				of the University of Ain Shams specializing in four areas in scientific calculations and 
				computer science, information systems and computer systems, a move towards Renaissance informatics 
				and preparing cadres outstanding on the national level and the Arab, where keen college to contribute 
				effectively in achieving the Renaissance Informatics hoped for this technology and updates from a real impact on the development
				of personal skills and abilities and increase the ability to think and dialogue.
				</p>
                
				<p>The relationship FCI era of the information revolution and come out of this revolution 
				explosive is effect relationship and influenced, the relationship nature dynamic sharp
				and variable requires us to take advantage of all available resources, both in terms 
				of academic or hand expertise to support the efficiency of scientific and educational through:
				
				</p>
				 
				<p >Carefully selected scientific methods to approach the global trends and advanced 
				educational institutions, so as to increase the ability of college graduates to cope 
				with the rapid changes in the field of information technology.
                Develop training programs to give the student practical experience and practical 
				through projects and working practices and summer training in partnership with different 
				sectors of production, leading to the development of problem-solving skills and 
				the generation of new knowledge.
				</p>
				
                <p> From here it was keen FCI Ain Shams University that includes distinct elements of faculty 
				members and their assistants from teaching assistants and recreating, than they have from the balance 
				of a huge body of knowledge and expertise of theoretical and applied as this privileged elite able to employ
				the available physical resources to support educational tasks and evaluate the performance of the student 
				and curriculum development, development, and management of the educational process in order to implement
				the highest and best possible level, including at least recognized international standards in this area.
                Keen College Administration to develop a policy distinct to develop research programs and do basic research 
				and applied research, and achieved successes in this area issuance scientific journal "International Journal of accounts smart 
				and science informatics" and Annual Report for the year "2002-2003" and until "2008 - 2009" and what they contain these patrols
				from dozens of applied scientific research.
				</p>
				
                <p >The Faculty of Computing and Information do not work in isolation from the social variables 
				related to development and environment and population growth, for this comes driven through a complete 
				understanding of the reality of things and understand the nature of the problems facing the country
				, and in this context has been keen college to participate awe-inspiring scientific and applied in the 
				implementation of programs of study in the field of computers.
